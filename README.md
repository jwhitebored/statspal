# statspal
Neural net made in TensorFlow to determine the statistical distribution governing a dataset. Intended use is to better understand the relevant statistics of a dataset, and give an informed choice of function to fit data to in standard curve fitting algorithms (non-linear regression) like SciPy's opt.curve_fit().
